Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.

First, understand the workflow he/she built in their improved version of their code.

Defining all the functions, latter run a simple condition to call a main function that handles all the other functions


Draw / write the workflow for yourself and note your doubts about it.

 - Ask to play for playing (loop) N - to quit at the end of each game
 - Enter to a main function
 - Call diferent functions every time to look for a WIN result
 - Prompt for new entry loop until WIN or Lose

Look for things he/she made that you think could be useful for you.

 - He already knows how to simplify all the code, but it means to recode everything


Now go to the first version of the code and compare it with the new version. Do you think the improvement is significant?

 - Due to no are to many changes, is much easier to read with jupyter


Is the git flow useful? Does it clarify some doubts you had?

 - Like me not to enough description commits


Try the game. Do you find something that could be improved? Does something surpises you? Set some glows and grows for your partner!

 - Instead of working with conditions, work with a dictonary with the possible convinations
 - Too many variables, so difficult to read
